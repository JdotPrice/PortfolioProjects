In this project, we predicted whether or not the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9
rocket launches on its website with a cost of $62 million, while other providers cost upward of $165 million. Much of
these savings are due SpaceXâ€™s ability to reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land
successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can then be used as leverage if an alternative
company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
